 Welcome to our ASRC Citizen Sensors Community! We're still building this space but feel free to utilize the materials available.
 Contents:
 Citizen Sensors-DIY CO2 How To.pdf : A step by step guide to creating your own DIY CO2 Sensor

Code-README.md : Readme for the RTC_SD_LCD_K30_v1.1.ino code

Intro to Calibrating CO2 sensors (1).pdf : How to Calibrate the CO2 Sensor. (most new sensors don't need to be calibrated, but it's a good check)

Components and Assembly Curriculum : A 2 hours workshop guide to assemble and test the CO2 Sensors. (all modifications will need to be completed in the how-to guide before this)

RTC_SD_LCD_K30_v1.1.ino : Arduino code to run the fully assembled system

readCO2.ino : Simple code to read in value from the CO2 Sensor and Arduino only

Contact kkrueger@gc.cuny.edu if you have any questions we'll try to answer!
