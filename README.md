# Air Quality Sensor üå± 

 Welcome to our ASRC Citizen Sensors Community! We're still building this space but feel free to use the materials available. Contact [kkrueger@gc.cuny.edu](mailto:kkrueger@gc.cuny.edu) if you have any questions. We'll try to answer!
 
 The Air Quaity Sensor (AQS) is a low-cost, low-power DIY device with sensors for CO2, temp-pressure-relativehumidity, and PM2.5 (dust or smoke). It has an on-board logger and WiFi connectivity to Google Sheets for (almost) real time data reporting.
